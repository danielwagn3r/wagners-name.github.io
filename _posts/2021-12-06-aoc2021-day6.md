The theme for today is:
> Sometimes looking up is better than searching

## Puzzle One

Think of clustering the lanternfish swarm into buckets of their current day of the creation cycle.

Use`GroupBy()` [^2] followed by `ToDictionary()` [^3] to compute the initial clustering:

```csharp
IDictionary<int, long> swarm = input.GroupBy(d => d).ToDictionary(i => i.Key, i => (long)i.Count());
```
Then you can computer the new clustering after an iteration by iterating over the buckets of your clustering and computing the new count of lanternfish and the new bucket(s).

## Puzzle Two

Puzzle two is only about performance. If your the implementation of puzzle one is efficient, it's just a change of parameters.
